- put dom elements in pageui.js
- make camera change using global-space coordinates
- start thinking about shooting
  - how to handle it on collision
  - character.js isnt the proper way to handle it
    - maybe with a body.js, something which handle only any bodies in the world
    - shoot, character, players
- rename player or character ?
  - ok but to got where ?
